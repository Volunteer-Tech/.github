# Welcome To Volunteer Tech®

Volunteer Tech® is a professional training and coaching non-profit institution founded by a young software engineer and researcher, Aklilu Mandefro in May 2016 with the goal of helping 
humanity forward and making the world a better place. We are here to inspire and empower the younger generation to be future-proof through our free-of-charge motivational skills training
in four areas: personal development, leadership, coding, and research, in a way that makes a difference in their lives and the world. Despite being originally based in two cities,
Gondar and Bahir Dar, in Ethiopia, our mission is to reach out to a wider community across Africa.​

We focus on creating future leaders, not bosses, by inspiring and empowering youth, especially those from low-income families and disadvantaged or marginalized communities,
to face their biggest fears and achieve their highest dreams. We inspire the next generation to build a better future not only for themselves but also for the rest of the world.
