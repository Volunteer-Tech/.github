# ðŸ“š About Volunteer TechÂ®

We are here to inspire and empower the younger generation to be future-proof through our free-of-charge pro skfessional skills training in four areas: coding, research, personal development, and leadership in a way that makes a difference in their lives and the world around them. Despite being originally based in two cities, Gondar and Bahir Dar, in Ethiopia, our mission is to reach out to a wider community across Africa.

â€‹We focus on creating future leaders by inspiring and empowering youth to help them create an impact on thier community through the use of technology and research. We inspire them to build a better future not only for themselves but also for the rest of the world.
